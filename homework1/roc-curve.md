## What is ROC-curve?

## Draw a ROC-curve

The first homework in ML course is to draw a ROC-curve.

I use python to draw this curve with two methods:

1. Use the definition of ROC curve.

2. Use the python lib about ROC curve.

The data is from my project simple-CNN to identify whether a written number is 0 or not. The figure shows that it has a good result.

The code is in `main.py`, and the data is in `result.txt`.
